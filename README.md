# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
This project predicts median house prices using the California Housing dataset available in sklearn.datasets. It applies Linear Regression to analyze how location and demographic features influence housing prices.

📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on features like population, average income, number of rooms, and location-based metrics.

🛠️ Key Features

Uses built-in California Housing dataset from Scikit-learn

Performs data preprocessing and feature scaling

Trains a Linear Regression model

Displays evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score

Visualization of relationships between features and target values (optional)

📂 Tech Stack

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)
